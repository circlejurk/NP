Project #1: Remote Access System (ras). 

In this homework, you are asked to design rsh-like access systems,
called remote access systems, including both 
client and server.  In this system, the server designates a directory, 
say ras/; then, clients can only run executable programs inside the 
directory, ras/.  

The following is a scenario of using the system.

csh> telnet myserver.nctu.edu.tw 7000 # the server port number
****************************************
** Welcome to the information server. **
****************************************
** You are in the directory, /home/studentA/ras/.
** This directory will be under "/", in this system.  
** This directory includes the following executable programs. 
** 
**	bin/
**	test.html	(test file)
**
** The directory bin/ includes: 
**	cat
**	ls
**	removetag		(Remove HTML tags.)
**	removetag0		(Remove HTML tags.)
**	number  		(Add a number in each line.)
**
** In addition, the following two commands are supported by ras. 
**	setenv	
**	printenv	
** 
% printenv PATH                       # Initial PATH is bin/ and ./
PATH=bin:.
% setenv PATH bin                     # Set to bin/ only
% printenv PATH
PATH=bin
% ls
bin/		test.html
% ls bin

Requirements and Hints: 

1. All data to stdout and stderr from server programs return to
clients.

2. The remote directory in the server at least needs to include
"removetag", "removetag0" and "number" and a test html file.  

3. The programs removetag and number are not important in this project. 
TAs will provide you with these two programs. 

4. You MUST use "exec" to run "ls", etc.  You MUST NOT use functions 
   like "system()" or some other functions (in lib) to do the job.

5. commands |n and !n The level number n is no more than 1000.

6. For commands that are empty or have errors, the pipe to the command is closed
   subsequently.  

Additional comments: 

1. All arguments MUST NOT INCLUDE "/" for security.
   You should print out error message instead.

2. You can still let stderr be the console output for your debugging messages. 

3. In addition to demo, you also need to prepare a simple report.

If you find some commands confusing or not working, please let me
know. Thanks.

Due date: 10/30


============================================================
If there is any different between hw1.txt and hw1Spec.txt, please follow the rule in hw1Spec.txt.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Input spec:

1.	The length of a single-line input will not exceed 15000 characters.
	There may be huge number of commands in a single-line input.
	Each command will not exceed 256 characters.

2.	There must be one or more spaces between commands and symbols (or arguments.), 
	but no spaces between pipe and numbers.

	eg. cat hello.txt | number
		cat hello.txt |4

3.	There will not be any '/' character in demo input.

4.	Pipe ("|") will not come with "printenv" and "setenv".

5.	Use '% ' as the command line prompt.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
About server:

1.	The welcome message MUST been shown as follows:
****************************************
** Welcome to the information server. **
****************************************

2.	Close the connection between the server and the client immediately when the server recieve "exit".

3.	Note that the forked process of server MUST be killed when the connection to the client is closed.
	Otherwise, there may be lots zombie processes.
	
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
About a numbered-pipe

1.	|N means the stdout of last command should be piped to the first command of next Nth line, where 1 <= N <= 1000.

2.	!N means both stdout and stderr of last command should be piped to the first command of next Nth line, where 1 <= N <= 1000.

3.	If there is any error in a input line, the line number still counts.

	eg. cat hello.txt |2
		ctt					<= unknown command, but the line number still counts
		number

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
About parsing:

1.	If there is command not found, print as follow:s
Unknown command: [command].

e.g. 	% ctt
		Unknown command: [ctt].

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other proposed:

1.	There must be "ls", "cat", "removetag", "removetag0", "number" in "bin/" of "ras/".

2.	You have to execute the files in "bin/" with an "exec()"-based function.(eg. execvp() or execlp() ...)

3.	Two of the commands (ls and cat) used in the homework are placed in the folder /bin.
	Please copy them in the folder ~/ras/bin/.
	(Example: cp /bin/ls /bin/cat ~/ras/bin/)
	
4.	Other commands, such as noop, number, removetag and remoetag0 are all packaged in the commands.rar.
	Please compile them by yourself and put the executable file into folder ~/ras/bin/.
	(Compile example: g++ noop.cpp -o ~/ras/bin/noop)
	
5.	After completing the server , you can test how it works by using telnet.
	(Command: telnet nplinux1.cs.nctu.edu.tw [port])
	By the way, if the OS of your computer is Win7, the telnet is closed in default, you can follow this link to open it:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
About submit format:
(Please follow the format to submit the project, or you won't get full score in the project.)

1.	create a directory named your student ID, put all your code in the same directory layer

2.	zip the directory (Attention!! we only accept .zip format), upload the .zip to the E3 platform

e.g.
	create a directory 0356169, in that directory may have

	/0356169/server.cpp
	/0356169/socket.cpp
	...
	
	zip it and get 0356169.zip, finally upload 0356169.zip to E3

	The most important announcement is that we take plagiarism very seriously.
	All projects will be checked for plagiarism.
	Any cases that have been discovered will be reported to the instructors and will get zero on this project.

About server:
(Choose your server according to the last digit of your student ID)

server						the last digit
npbsd0.cs.nctu.edu.tw			0
npbsd1.cs.nctu.edu.tw			1
npbsd2.cs.nctu.edu.tw			2
npbsd3.cs.nctu.edu.tw			3
npbsd4.cs.nctu.edu.tw			4
nplinux0.cs.nctu.edu.tw			5

nplinux2.cs.nctu.edu.tw			7
nplinux3.cs.nctu.edu.tw			8
nplinux4.cs.nctu.edu.tw			9

e.g.	0356169 use nplinux4.cs.nctu.edu.tw
(If you do not have a workstation account, you need to visit the website: https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cscc/account/ and apply for a workstation account at the computer center of CSIE deparment.)

If your server have any problem, please choose another server with less user.
(Command: who -q)

Note:

1.	Any abuse of system will be recorded.

2.	NP project should be run on NP server, or your account will be locked.

3.	Be sure to clean zombie process.
	(Command: ps aux | less)

4.	Don't attack other student's program!
